# Simon Game

## Description

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors flashed by the game. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging. This implementation of the Simon Game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Start Game**: Press any key to start the game.
- **Color Sequence**: The game will flash a sequence of colors that the player must replicate.
- **Level Progression**: The game advances to higher levels as the player successfully replicates the sequence.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the player makes an incorrect sequence choice, with a score displayed.
- **Visual Indicators**: Buttons flash with different colors to indicate the current sequence and user interactions.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Observe the sequence of colors that flash.
3. Click on the buttons in the same sequence to repeat the pattern.
4. The sequence will grow longer with each successful replication.
